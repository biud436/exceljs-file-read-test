# Introduction

This program allows you to read lines from the excel file. Each lines would be stored to the database.

# Usage

To use this tool, note that you need to step these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/biud436/exceljs-file-read-test.git
cd exceljs-file-read-test
npm install
npm run start -- --file=res/M_GB16.9L-2_20211201_140029.xlsx
```

To use a node module named `chalk` in the typescript environment, you need to install `chalk@^4` only. In case of `chalk@^5`, `ESM module` is not supported, so it couldn't use it.
